The dispute spiralled into the tunnel, forcing stewards to intervene, and led to heated exchanges between members of both benches.</p> <p>It was a while before Mike Dean, the referee, was able to restore order. Once the dust had settled, however, Sarri was quick to accept the blame and criticise Ianni’s actions. Mourinho, who accused Chelsea’s fans of disrespecting him, also attempted to draw a line under the matter despite saying that Ianni’s actions were down to a “bad education”.</p> <p>“I didn’t see anything on the pitch but after the match I spoke with José and immediately understood that we are wrong,” Sarri said. “I have spoken with the member of my staff and then I bring him to speak with Mourinho to say sorry to him. I think it is finished. We made a mistake. We were in the wrong.”</p> <p>Sarri is yet to decide if he is will punish Ianni. “I have dealt with the situation immediately,” the Italian said. “I have to speak to him again because I want to be sure he is able to understand that it was a big mistake. I have to view everything. Now the situation is between me and the staff face to face.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5b4b148d0839bf98342190824f3e4a589c62a7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5b4b148d0839bf98342190824f3e4a589c62a7c/0_171_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marco Ianni\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarri has not yet decided whether he will punish Marco Ianni.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: TGSPhoto/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There were so many bodies involved that it was difficult for Dean to get a good view of what happened. The Football Association will have to wait for Dean’s report and view the footage before deciding whether to discipline either club.</p> <p>It is thought that Mourinho meant that Ianni was guilty of a lack of manners when he spoke about the Italian’s education. In any case, United’s manager was not in a mood to prolong the argument.</p> <p>“Not celebrations, bad education,” the Portuguese said. “But I also made mistakes in football matches and will make more. I accepted his apologies. Maurizio saw and said he would take care of it internally and to accept his apology, which I did. Then the young fellow came and apologised and I told him I accepted. I said: ‘I did mistakes when I was your age’.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/oct/20/chelsea-manchester-united-player-ratings\">Chelsea 2-2 Manchester United: how the players rated at Stamford Bridge</a> </p> </aside>  <p>United were on the verge of securing their first win at Stamford Bridge since 2012 after mounting an impressive comeback in the second half, with Anthony Martial scoring twice after Antonio Rüdiger had given Chelsea an early lead. Yet Mourinho ended up questioning why Dean played so much stoppage time after Barkley snatched a point for the hosts in the 96th minute. “The referee gave six minutes,” he said. “Normally when I am losing I never get six minutes. I do not know where the extra time came from. But that is football.”</p> <p>United, who host Juventus in the Champions League on Tuesday, showed enough promise to suggest that Mourinho still has the support of his players after weeks of speculation about his future at Old Trafford. Martial was excellent in the second half and Mourinho refused to criticise Paul Pogba for losing Rüdiger when the Chelsea defender headed in the opening goal from a corner.</p> <p>“My feeling is that we work on the pitch,” Mourinho said. “We defend mixed, so some players are in zones and some have individual opponents.

          "bodyText": "Maurizio Sarri apologised to Manchester United and admitted Chelsea were in the wrong after one of his coaches sparked a furious touchline row with José Mourinho. Mourinho leapt from his seat on United’s bench to confront Marco Ianni after Sarri’s assistant coach celebrated Ross Barkley’s dramatic late equaliser for Chelsea by pumping his fists in front of the away dugout at Stamford Bridge. The dispute spiralled into the tunnel, forcing stewards to intervene, and led to heated exchanges between members of both benches. It was a while before Mike Dean, the referee, was able to restore order. Once the dust had settled, however, Sarri was quick to accept the blame and criticise Ianni’s actions. Mourinho, who accused Chelsea’s fans of disrespecting him, also attempted to draw a line under the matter despite saying that Ianni’s actions were down to a “bad education”. “I didn’t see anything on the pitch but after the match I spoke with José and immediately understood that we are wrong,” Sarri said. “I have spoken with the member of my staff and then I bring him to speak with Mourinho to say sorry to him. I think it is finished. We made a mistake. We were in the wrong.” Sarri is yet to decide if he is will punish Ianni. “I have dealt with the situation immediately,” the Italian said. “I have to speak to him again because I want to be sure he is able to understand that it was a big mistake. I have to view everything. Now the situation is between me and the staff face to face.” There were so many bodies involved that it was difficult for Dean to get a good view of what happened. The Football Association will have to wait for Dean’s report and view the footage before deciding whether to discipline either club. It is thought that Mourinho meant that Ianni was guilty of a lack of manners when he spoke about the Italian’s education. In any case, United’s manager was not in a mood to prolong the argument. “Not celebrations, bad education,” the Portuguese said. “But I also made mistakes in football matches and will make more. I accepted his apologies. Maurizio saw and said he would take care of it internally and to accept his apology, which I did. Then the young fellow came and apologised and I told him I accepted. I said: ‘I did mistakes when I was your age’.” United were on the verge of securing their first win at Stamford Bridge since 2012 after mounting an impressive comeback in the second half, with Anthony Martial scoring twice after Antonio Rüdiger had given Chelsea an early lead. Yet Mourinho ended up questioning why Dean played so much stoppage time after Barkley snatched a point for the hosts in the 96th minute. “The referee gave six minutes,” he said. “Normally when I am losing I never get six minutes. I do not know where the extra time came from. But that is football.” United, who host Juventus in the Champions League on Tuesday, showed enough promise to suggest that Mourinho still has the support of his players after weeks of speculation about his future at Old Trafford. Martial was excellent in the second half and Mourinho refused to criticise Paul Pogba for losing Rüdiger when the Chelsea defender headed in the opening goal from a corner. “My feeling is that we work on the pitch,” Mourinho said. “We defend mixed, so some players are in zones and some have individual opponents. Sometimes the opponent is better than us. In this case Antonio was really strong in the movement. Players make mistakes. I prefer to focus on the global performance. My midfield was very good. Paul was good.” It was an eventful return to his former club for Mourinho. After the final whistle he held up three fingers to signify the number of league titles he won across two spells at Stamford Bridge. “I did not get respect back from Chelsea fans but that is not my responsibility,” Mourinho said.",

No hard border in Ireland.” While he’s not Irish, Peter said: “I remember the Troubles from the 70s. That’s no reason to take the status quo for granted. People forget too soon the benefits of the Good Friday agreement.”</p> \n  <p>He said it filled him with despair to hear people talk of scrapping the Good Friday agreement in the hopes of a clean exit out of the EU. “The whole Irish economy could be so badly affected and then you look at history and the way we’ve treated them in the past, it’s a bit of a rough deal for them. They deserve better treatment from us.”<br></p> \n  <p>Derick, 35, who lives in London, was waving an rainbow flag and marching with an LGBT group. He said he had come to the march because he was “concerned that this might be one of the last opportunity to get through how serious the situation is”.</p> \n  <p>“It’s pretty terrifying and I’m transgender and basically most of my rights as a person has come from the EU. If we leave the EU, I am liable to not become a person,” he said.<br></p> \n  <p>Matthew Cooke, 28, who had come down from Scunthorpe with the Modern Union for a Changing World, described the prospect of a no-deal Brexit as “terrifying”.<br><br>“Brexit in its guise is no good for jobs, no good for workers rights and no good for people’s finance,” he said. “It would be remiss not to be out here to not get a better future for everybody.” Cooke, who has worked as both a steelworker and a trade unionist, said it was the duty of the union to fight to get better deals for their workers.<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-10-20T15:24:57.595Z\">at 4.24pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5bcb408fe4b0dfdbdb810d0e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-10-20T14:50:25.536Z\">3.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/peoplesvote_uk/status/1053658974258712576\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">WATCH: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NicolaSturgeon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NicolaSturgeon</a>'s address to our massive crowd of 670,000 at the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PeoplesVoteMarch?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#PeoplesVoteMarch</a>.

          "bodyText": "The organisers of today’s march now estimate that there were 700,000 people demonstrating. This is one for the history books. Jessica Elgot, the Guardian’s political correspondent, wonders why today’s Leave Means Leave rally was held in Harrogate - one of the few places to back remain in Yorkshire. Meanwhile, Farage allegedly jumped the queue for the bar ahead of the event. His is a pint of bitter. Guy Verhofstadt, the Belgian politicians who has been intimately involved in Brexit negotiations, has said that while the UK may leave the EU “it won’t stop people feeling European”. Jacob Rees-Mogg, perhaps predictably, has given the march short shrift: The march is officially over, but the streets are still jam-packed. Here are a few more photos we missed earlier: The Labour MP Chuka Umunna, whose Lambeth constituency was the most pro-remain in England at the referendum, criticised Brexiters who “have tried to smear us as some liberal metropolitan elite, when nothing could be further from the truth”. Right from the start of this debate they tried to set different parts of our United Kingdom against each other. They wanted to divide this country. And the truth is, whether you are from a remain or leave area, the problems are the same. Whether you are from Liverpool, Lincoln, Llandudno, Livingston in Scotland or Lambeth, where I am, Brexit is not going to make those problems better. It is going to make them worse. The deal on the table is nowhere near as good as the deal we’ve got now. The standup comic John Bishop pleads with the government in all seriousness: Sadiq Khan notes the diversity of the crowd: The comedian Dom Joly contrasted today’s rally with last Saturday’s march by the far-right Football Lads Democratic Alliance. Addressing the crowd in Parliament Square earlier, the Lib Dem leader, Vince Cable, said it was “a tragedy this country is being divided by generation”. He said it was the majority of his generation that voted to leave, taking the freedom away from young voters. “There is no deal better than the one we have now. It is better for Britain and better for Europe,” he said to cheers. Following his speech, Cable added: “I think people have woken up to the potential disaster. Even if they negotiate a deal, it’s going to be a bad deal, where we’re going to spend years under European Union rules but have no say in them and beyond that there’s a cliff edge. “We’ve realised there isn’t a good deal coming out of this and a lot of people are frightened, people are worried.” From Brexcrement and Brexshit to a Banksy-inspired placard, here are the best banners of the day. The Observer journalist Carole Cadwalladr, whose series of stories caused Facebook’s share value to tumble and Cambridge Analytica to fold, is being trumpeted as a future prime minister. Stranger things have happened ... The Green party MP Caroline Lucas described the huge crowd as a beautiful sight. What a movement we have become. The Green party is proud to be part of this amazing movement for a people’s vote, because we know that democracy didn’t end on the 23 June 2016. That referendum wasn’t the end of the story. It was the start of something new. [Brexit] would make our poorest communities even poorer and more powerless. We must have that people’s vote, but we must also re-programme an economy that fails so many, that is based on such inequality, that condemns us to climate breakdown. Another roundup of photos from today, with a video from Anna Soubry’s speech. The Conservative MP Anna Soubry told crowds in Parliament Square that “it is clear we are the many” and that “we will take responsibly and sort out this mess”. More protesters have told our reporter about their fears of a no-deal Brexit and the potential effect it could have on peace in Ireland, the economy, and LGBT rights. Peter, 60, from Crawley, had created a large banner that read: “Would an honourable country renege on a peace treaty? No hard border in Ireland.” While he’s not Irish, Peter said: “I remember the Troubles from the 70s. That’s no reason to take the status quo for granted. People forget too soon the benefits of the Good Friday agreement.” He said it filled him with despair to hear people talk of scrapping the Good Friday agreement in the hopes of a clean exit out of the EU. “The whole Irish economy could be so badly affected and then you look at history and the way we’ve treated them in the past, it’s a bit of a rough deal for them. They deserve better treatment from us.” Derick, 35, who lives in London, was waving an rainbow flag and marching with an LGBT group. He said he had come to the march because he was “concerned that this might be one of the last opportunity to get through how serious the situation is”. “It’s pretty terrifying and I’m transgender and basically most of my rights as a person has come from the EU. If we leave the EU, I am liable to not become a person,” he said. Matthew Cooke, 28, who had come down from Scunthorpe with the Modern Union for a Changing World, described the prospect of a no-deal Brexit as “terrifying”. “Brexit in its guise is no good for jobs, no good for workers rights and no good for people’s finance,” he said. “It would be remiss not to be out here to not get a better future for everybody.” Cooke, who has worked as both a steelworker and a trade unionist, said it was the duty of the union to fight to get better deals for their workers. Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader, just addressed the crowd at Parliament Square via video link. It appears that Rachel Johnson, sister of the former foreign secretary, attended the march in London today. Like Boris, Jason Gillot, a 43-year-old Londoner who is on the march today, also changed his mind significantly on Brexit – albeit slightly after Boris. Gillot originally voted to leave the EU, but said he changed his mind five days after the referendum. “I’m politically agnostic but I was just sick of the lies that have come out of both sides,” he said, going on to explain he initially voted to leave due to “economic evidence partly supplied by the Tax Payers’ Alliance” which “made sense at the time”. “Now we have actual facts and realities of what’s going to be happening,” he said. Gillot has been marching with a sign that says “When the facts change, I change my mind! What do you do sir?” Elsewhere, in Harrogate, at the Leave Means Leave rally there are reportedly 1,200 people in attendance. Sky have reported that Nigel Farage claimed “millions” of people were streaming the pro-Brexit events; however, on Twitter, 190 people are watching the Harrogate event, while there are 12,000 views on its Facebook stream. The tail of the protest has now moved on to Piccadilly, far later than planned, indicating the scale of the turnout today. ITV’s Robert Peston has tried to give us all a sense of the size of the march. The Metropolitan police have said today’s march has passed without incident, in spite of the sheer size of the demonstration. A spokesperson said they were not aware of any arrests and there had been no criminal disruption. The scale of today’s protest places it in the upper echelons of protests since the millennium. A march organised by the Countryside Alliance in 2002 calling for Liberty &amp; Livelihood reportedly attracted more than 400,000 people, while the TUC’s March for the Alternative anti-cuts protest in 2011 also saw around 400,000 people take to the streets. The organisers of protests against Trump’s visit earlier this year said more than 250,000 people attended. However, the Stop the War protest against the War in Iraq in 2003 still ranks at the most well-attended after 2000, with 2,000,000 people according to organisers, although the police claimed just 750,000 were there. MPs have also tweeted their support for a people’s vote. Sadiq Khan is now addressing the crowds at Parliament Square. Ahead of his platform performance he said today would become a historic moment, adding that no one had voted to “make life harder for our children and grandchildren”. Today will go down as an historic moment in our democracy. A moment when in their thousands, people from every corner of our country and every section of our society will take to the streets – coming to make our voice heard. The lies, the mistruths and the deceptions of the referendum campaign have now been exposed, and it’s clear the will of the people is changing. No one voted to leave the EU to make themselves poorer. No one voted to make life harder for our children and grandchildren. No one voted to see our NHS damaged. And no one voted for the shambles that this government has created. The actor Andy Serkis, who starred in Lord of the Rings, is on the march with his wife, Lorraine Ashbourne, and 14-year-old son Louis. He believes there should be a second referendum “now that people are more informed” and that “the will of the people doesn’t have to stand still, it’s not an immovable thing that is fixed.” “The will of the people is now, it’s people expressing their points of view in a more informed state,” he said. Serkis expressed concern for the film industry if the UK were to leave the EU. “There’s free movement between the European countries and we’ve attracted a lot of industry here as a result and that could be seriously damaged, which is the same for a lot of industries,” he said. Diana Luck, from Muswell Hill, is one of many women on the march carrying various homemade ‘angry granny’ signs. Her’s simply reads “Very Angry Grandmother”. “I am very angry at the things that are happening like Brexit and Trump and very worried about the future for my children and grandchildren,” she said. “I think that’s true for all of us angry grannies.” She added she was marching because democracy was being eroded and the things she believes in, like the NHS, were being threatened. Meanwhile, Joe Trickey, from Croydon, is celebrating his 83rd birthday at the march. “I believe very strongly in the EU as a place of peace and strength,” he said. “Going out puts us in isolation and leaving isn’t about trade deals, it’s about our values.” Trickey is protesting alongside his daughter, who is holding a sign about his birthday, and plans to celebrate afterwards with “a glass of wine”. A brief reminder on what may have compelled people to take to the streets in droves today. Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland, has sent a surprise video message of support to the rally promising that the SNP’s 35 MPs would give their unconditional backing for a people’s vote. Let me say this loudly and clearly, if the issue comes before the House of Commons, SNP MPs will support a people’s vote which includes the option to remain in the EU. The leave campaign has already gone down in history as one of most disingenuous, dishonourable and downright dishonest electoral contests of modern times. Those responsible should be utterly ashamed of themselves. Instead of a coherent vision and clear prospectus setting out what a vote to leave the EU would mean, all we got was waffle and that infamous lie on the side of a bus. Incredible though it may seem, things since then have got even worse. The Tory government’s handling of these negotiations has been chaotic, incompetent and shambolic. Having spent two years telling us that no deal was better than a bad deal, the prime minister is now preparing to pile pressure on MPs to vote for a bad or blindfold deal on the grounds that ‘no deal’ would be catastrophic. She is trying to scare the UK into the frying pan out of fear of the fire. It is a scandal and it should not be accepted. There are still thousands of people at Hyde Park corner stuck in a jam before they are expected to make their way down Piccadilly. It appears that the police dramatically under-estimated the number of marchers, but they are being kept happy with various chants and a sound system blaring out Kraftwerk’s TransEurop Express. The march is finally moving, but progressing incredibly slowly. It’s frequently stopping and starting. The roads are rammed with protesters, many of whom are happily dancing along to the samba band. Louise Penn, who travelled down from Norfolk, was pleased that so many people had turned up. “We brought London to a standstill and that’s a message in of itself,” she said. “I’m doing this partly for myself, but for my children and their children. This is for the future of the country.” Peter De Clercq, 39, came down with Penn on the same bus. He said at the last people’s vote march there was only one bus coming down from Norfolk, but this morning there was six buses full of protesters heading to London. He was incredibly happy with the turnout. De Clercq, who is originally from Belgium, said that after living in the UK for 18 years he felt he was suddenly being stripped of his right. “I’m losing my rights. I can’t vote. I didn’t have a vote before and we all deserve the vote,” he said. “I’m doing this for every European citizen, including the British.” Protesters have brought traffic to a standstill in central London as the march proves far more popular than initially expected. David Mitchell, chairman of the Enfield Liberal Democrat group, suggested the large turnout it was partly down to how negotiations had floundered in recent weeks. “I think it’s due partly to how the negotiations have gone in the past six months, but it’s also a credit to the European movement who have really got themselves organised,” he said, describing the group of protesters at today’s march as twice as many than at the march in June. “Enfield overwhelmingly voted to stay in the EU and we want to make it clear that Enfield is committed to staying in the European Union. “The polls are showing that we voted to have a go at this process, it hasn’t worked, so now the people need to have a say on how we’re going with it,” he added. “It’s now or never really, we’re getting to crunch time.” More photos from the march: Organisers are heralding the largest Brexit demonstration yet as 570,000 people come together for the People’s Vote march. The campaign has stewards stationed at regular intervals to estimate the size of the vast crowd that backed up Park Lane and spilled into Hyde Park before setting off toward Piccadilly and a mass rally in Parliament Square. “Shortly after midday the sheer weight of number forced the closure of not only the southbound but also the northbound carriage way of Park Lane as the size of the crowd soared far above the massive march for a People’s Vote in June this year,” said a spokesperson. “This makes it the second biggest demonstration this century behind the 1 million estimated to have protested against the Iraq War in 2003.” Activist Adam Bradford, one of the leading voices in the young People’s Vote and founder of group Brexit by Under 30s, says we face a bleak future and young voices need amplifying. Young voices need amplifying in the Brexit debate and the misconceptions around what a People’s Vote really means need to be unravelled. I feel like the government does not constitutionally have the mandate to change the country in this way overnight, I am feeling vulnerable as an employer of EU citizens and now the government is turning inwards we are facing a bleak future. We have this rhetoric coming from Downing Street which keeps saying it is delivering on the “will of the people” and we are in a situation where the government is trying to force through a deal that is being held up like this is something we voted to do. But people actually voted whether to leave or remain in the EU. We didn’t vote for this Segway into a hard Brexit with the outcome unknown. The government does not have the mandate to fundamentally change the country overnight. Before we actually had the vote, we should have been better informed and we should have been immediately aware of what leaving would mean. The government is closed off to what people are saying, it is turning its back on our concerns and turning inwards. We are not Brexiteers and we are not “remoaners”. We just want to know how we will be supported. The government is playing politics with the next generation’s future. On the march, Elena Remigi, founder of the In Limbo project, has spoken of the “turmoil” EU citizens in Britain and Brits residing in the EU have been in since the Brexit vote. As part of the project, the group has collected testimonies from both groups and published two books. “It tells of the turmoil after the 2016 referendum and the fact our rights haven’t been guaranteed,” she said. “We have been used as bargaining chips and now we risk becoming collateral damage.” Meanwhile, Peter Andrews - who was among the 500 people to have travelled to London with the group Bath for Europe - said that Brexit will ruin his children’s future. “We must have a people’s vote,” he said. “I believe leaving Europe is the stupidest idea I have ever come across. It will ruin my children’s future and it will ruin my future.” Andrews, who was handing out fake bank notes with Jacob Rees-Mogg’s face on, added that “Britain is being led by extreme right wing fanatics.” The group issued several notes, including a 350 million note. Rees-Mogg’s face had been chosen to be plastered on a 50 Guineas note because he was trying “to take us back in time,” Andrews said. Whether the notes will be accepted as legal tender, a la Banksy’s 2004 Di-Faced Tenner stunt, remains to be seen. This is rather good. The actor and seasoned campaigner Hugh Grant has tweeted his regret that he could not attend today’s march. Some of Grant’s contemporaries, however, were able to make it. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who campaigned for remain but was part of the anti-EU Bennite faction of the party before his rapid rise, is also absent from today’s march: Four packed coaches set off at 9am from Birmingham, which voted marginally in favour of Brexit in 2016, to carry people to the march in London. At 12.30pm they arrived on Park Lane and the passengers, kitted out with EU flags, T-shirts, banners, badges and whistles, immediately swarmed towards the crowd as it inched eastwards towards Westminster. Flora, 12, who took the coach with her friend Leah, also 12, said: “I’ve come down to join the protest because I don’t agree with Brexit. I have family in France and it’s going to be much harder to see them if we leave. “I’m really sad because one of my best friends from school has moved to Germany, because she didn’t like what was happening here.” Leah, meanwhile, said that while her mum had voted to leave and her dad had backed remain, she wanted her future to be in Europe. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, will address the crowd later today. He told Sky earlier that calls for a second vote should not be confused with support for “neverendums”, arguing that politicians could not be trusted to make the right decision. “I can’t think of anything more democratic or British than trusting the British people,” he said. “Some of the promises made two years ago have not materialised. Nobody was talking about a bad deal, or no deal whatsoever. The public should have a say on the outcomes, with the option of staying in the EU “Jeremy Corbyn and Labour are quite clear, all the options should remain on the table. But the prime minister can’t get her own cabinet to agree, let alone her party. “Nobody was saying we won’t have access to the single market, nobody was talking about damaging the NHS, and so we should ask the British public, with the option of staying in the EU. “As it is now, the NHS is stockpiling medicine, our police are planning for civil unrest, our prime minister can’t get a deal through cabinet. Let the people have a say,” he added. Campaigners are being led to Parliament Square by a group of young voters behind a People’s Vote banner. Emma Stevens and Emily Longman are two of the students leading the march and are among the hundreds of thousands of young people who were denied a vote in the referendum but must now live with the consequences. Longman, 20, said she was four months too young to vote in the referendum. “We’re both Spanish students due to study abroad next year, but no one knows what will happen with Erasmus funding,” she said. Stevens, also 20, said: “We don’t want the other European countries to hold the same view [of leaving the EU].” While anti-Brexit protesters gathered for the People’s Vote march, Theresa May visited an art exhibition in her constituency of Maidenhead. Titled Maidenhead and Me, the exhibition featured work by locals with different perspectives of the town. One of the works was called Bridge Over Troubled Brexit Waters and depicted May carrying a cross over a river of bad Brexit headlines. Here’s the prime minister perusing the gallery last month. Marching under an “Islanders for Europe” sign, Glenn Kobanny said he had travelled from the Isle of Wight this morning to be part of the protest. The 52-year-old, originally from the island, said: “It’s just a load of nonsense, it was a bunch of lies to begin with. “I’m sorry that people fell for the lies but we speak to leavers as much as we talk to remainers and they’re just as fed up with it as well.” Meanwhile, ahead of a Leave means Leave rally in Harrogate, Nigel Farage has told Sky that he would be happy to have a second referendum. Recent polling has showed that 46% of the public believe that, in hindsight, Britain was wrong to vote to leave the European Union. Conversely, 43% of people thought the UK was right to leave. Campaigners also hope to unleash a tide of postal protest aimed at MPs by issuing 100,000 postcards emblazoned with the words “Brexit has already become a dog’s dinner – the whole process is going badly wrong. And it’s only going to get worse.” A spokesman for The People’s Vote said it was time to tell politicians they will not be forgiven “if they allow a bad deal to be rammed through parliament” or “blindfold the public about the long-term cost of Brexit”. You can read the full story behind today’s protest by our Brexit correspondent Lisa O’Carroll here: Jo Steele, who works at St Michael’s and All Saints charity, estimates that more than 250 people have come down from Oxford to join the march. “We support the EU, we want to remain in the EU, and we are marching for democracy,” she said. “We need a further referendum on the final deal with the option to remain.” She described the possibility of a no deal as a “total disaster”, warning the UK may well sleep walk into it. “Negotiations aren’t going anywhere. Theresa May isn’t in control of her cabinet, her party and the country.” Demonstrators are now marching along the eastern edge of Hyde Park. They are expected to turn on to Piccadilly, before proceeding along St James Street and Pall Mall to get to Trafalgar Square. Protesters will head down Whitehall, past Downing Street, before eventually gathering in Parliament Square where speeches in support of a people’s vote will be held from 2pm. Here are some photos from earlier today: The Labour MP David Lammy, one of the most vocal proponents of a second vote, has urged people not to accept the idea that it is impossible to stop Brexit. Lammy has been increasingly critical of the Brexit negotiations and has publicly lambasted key Brexiteers for alleged conflicts of interest. Around 400 protesters made up of British expatriates living in Europe, some of whom travelled from Italy and France, and EU citizens residing in the UK have gathered in Hyde Park to call for the right to vote in a final referendum. The group have united under the umbrella group the Five Million, which refers to the number of EU citizens in Britain and UK citizens residing in the EU. Protesters chanted “we are the three million” in English, Spanish, Italian, French and German. They also called for the “Brexit bus to crash” Kalba Meadows, a coordinator of Remain in France Together and a member of the British in Europe’s steering committee, travelled from French Pyrenees to join the march. “I am here for two reasons: I’m here to show how strong we are as a group and celebrate everything we’ve done together over the last two years,” she said. “I am here because we’ve been disenfranchised from the referendum. I am here to demand that the people most affected by Brexit actually have a say in what happens.” Axel Antoni, 44, a spokesperson for the campaign group 3 Million, said: “It’s a very specific demand: we want a final say for all. the UK is our home. We are part of it. EU citizens didn’t even have a vote last time, we didn’t have a voice last time.” Thousands of people from across the country have converged on the capital to demand a final say on the terms of the Brexit deal. The People’s Vote March is due to set off from Park Lane at midday and will end in a rally in Parliament Square. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, and the celebrity chef Delia Smith are among those due to speak at the event, while the Green party MP Caroline Lucas and the human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell tweeted from where protesters are gathering. Simon Chater is part of the Devon for Europe group, which arranged eight coaches to bring campaigners to London for the event. The 69-year-old from South Devon said: “This is the first time in my life I’ve been political.” The march comes as the Brexit negotiations enter a crucial stage, with deep splits in both the main parties fuelling uncertainty over whether the government will be able to command enough support in parliament to ratify any deal it agrees with the EU27.",

          "bodyText": "To Scotland … Louise Taylor was at St James’ Park. Stalemate on the South Coast. Ed Aarons was at Molineux. David Hytner was at the London Stadium. A telling quote from a Newcastle United fan here: “The most exciting bit of the match today was when I realised I had mobile phone signal for the first time ever in the Gallowgate end.” Sorry, Neil. Stuart James saw Cardiff grab their first win of the season and pull themselves clear of the relegation zone. Ben Fisher saw the new dawn at Aston Villa. It will soon be time to consider the day’s final Premier League match. The reports are rolling in. Paul Wilson was at the Etihad. Manchester City will be top of the league at the weekend’s conclusion unless Liverpool manage to beat Huddersfield 12-0. What a moment. Derby County’s team of 2007-8, Paul Jewell, Robbie Savage etc etc, keep their place in history. Newcastle have lost all of their first five home matches. Kayal’s goal was a fluke but Newcastle’s lack of goals leaves them bottom of the table. Cardiff have climbed above them. That makes it 25 goals that Fulham have already conceded. Oh dear. Great win for Cardiff, though. Bournemouth blew the best chances of a poor game. And Macclesfield Town have won! The pain is over! Staying up surely. Lamela’s goal scraps Spurs to another win at the London. Joe Hart’s worst nightmare descended. Two early goals did the damage. Into injury time at the Moss Rose. Four minutes to go.... Oh dear, Fulham. More chaos and Cardiff make hay again, slotting in at the back post. A bad day for Joe Hart. He is blameless for all of City’s goals but he has been left unprotected. Celtic make it 4-2 against Hibs with another Edouard goal. Cardiff goalkeeper Neil Etheridge has just made a fine save to protect his team’s lead against Fulham. Alfie Mawson must have thought he had scored. West Ham had the ball in the net but it was offside. No surprise to hear that Chicharito Hernandez was the offender. Macclesfield are winning! It’s 2-1 against Carlisle. Peter Vincenti with the goal. Can they hang on? Joe Hart rooted to the spot as Mahrez lashes home from 25 yards. Peter Oh emails in: “Marko Arnautovic involved in jersey-shredding handbags? Proof that he is certainly fit to tear the shirt!” Birmingham score against Stoke, where Gary Rowett is under pressure. In the Championship, Wigan have scored against West Brom, chasing promotion. Macclesfield Town equalise! Michael Rose slots home a 79th minute penalty. Just ten minutes now to save themselves. It looks like Newcastle may have run out of ideas. Aston Villa clinging on to that early lead against Swansea. JT and Deano on course for the points, though. Nerves for Brendan as Hibernian peg Celtic back to 3-2 after a goal from Martin Boyle. Hubert O’Hearn tweets in: “I know you’re absolutely correct, but ‘in the last century’ sounds so long ago. It summons to mind images of Keegan with a waxed moustache and Woodcock lifting a meerschaum out of his mouth just long enough to say, ‘Have at it, brave lads all!’” Newcastle are huffing and puffing at St James’ Park. Brighton’s defence dealing well with a series of crosses into their box. Up in Scotland, Celtic are leading Hibernian 3-1 after a goal from Odsonne Edouard. More chaos in the Fulham defence, and Paterson scores a deflected goal. Cardiff on course to climb out of the bottom three. Managerless, winless Macc Town are pushing for an equaliser. It isn’t coming... Correction on Robben: not sent off for diving. It was a foul for the second offence. But rest easy, Daniel Lees. The first was a dive. Josh King has just missed a golden chance for Bournemouth against Southampton. Eddie Howe agonises: no goals yet in the South Coast derby. Word on Reiss Nelson: he became the third Englishman to score two goals in a Bundesliga game, following Kevin Keegan (for Hamburg) and Tony Woodcock (for FC Cologne) in the last century. Handbags at the London Stadium between Davinson Sanchez and Marko Arnautovic. Sanchez has a ripped shirt but both players stay on the pitch. Daniel Lees again: “I take it back. There IS sentence which is better to read for a true football fan: “Joey Barton is not happy about it.” And now Kevin de Bruyne is on for City. More growling from Sean Dyche. Fernandinho’s goal was a powerful side-footed shot, very coolly done. City now running riot after not being able to put Burnley away in the first half. Fernandinho smashes home from long range. Sean Dyche is still growling about City’s second. The ball may have gone over the line before the Portuguese midfielder slotted home but City are headed for the top of the league. That was a triumph of David Silva not giving up a loss cause. Daniel Lees emails in: “For a true football fan, is there a better sentence to read…..”Arjen Robben has been sent off for diving. It seems to be karma finally repaying Mr Robben.....If only there were a German equivalent for schadenfreude.” In League One, leaders Portsmouth have a lead against Fleetwood after Oliver Hawkins’ goal. Joey Barton is not happy about it. Oh no! Macclesfield Town are heading for misery. Carlisle have scored through Ashley Nadesan. 37 games without a Football League win surely beckons. Bayern now winning 3-1 thanks to a goal from James Rodriguez. That will show those nasty journalists. Back underway in the second halves. Hugo Lloris has just made a fine save from Arnautovic to deny a West Ham equaliser. Danny Taylor was at Stamford Bridge for the drama and punch-up. Dr Ian Copestake emails in from Germany with a little bit of politics. “I am glad the update on Murray did not confirm that he has been taken to hospital for a scan and will be seen in four hours.” (Ian is not that sort of doctor.) Been a busy half-time, but here’s some recommended reading. News from Germany: Bayern are leading Wolfsburg 2-1, but Arjen Robben has been sent off for diving. Robert Lewandowski has scored both goals, while meanwhile, another young Englishmen is making hay in the Bundesliga. Two goals for Reiss Nelson, on loan from Arsenal, for Hoffenheim. And that’s half-time at St James’ Park. Newcastle’s game still going on after that Glenn Murray injury; he was taken to hospital. The news is that he is conscious and now having a scan. Bournemouth 0-0 Southampton Cardiff 2-2 Fulham Manchester City 1-0 Burnley Newcastle 0-1 Brighton (latest score) West Ham 0-1 Tottenham Wolves 0-2 Watford Joe Hart, he of the training pitch, makes a fantastic save to deny David Silva, and then Aguero misses from a yard out. Burnley still in it. Just. Joe Hart waves to fans at half-time, which is novel. Newcastle go close through Kenedy’s drive over the bar. The home fans yet to desert their team, despite a truly awful home record this season. Spurs break the deadlock, as the Argentinian continues his great decent goal record with a glancing header. Grady Diangana has come on to replace the stricken Yarmolenko, who suffered an injury to his calf, it seems. Robert Snodgrass in the thick of the action for West Ham against Spurs. He has had an unlikely renaissance under Manuel Pellegrini. Not a bad player, but neither Slaven Bilic nor David Moyes fancied him much...meanwhile, Yarmolenko has gone down heavily and will not be able to continue. Bad news for the Hammers. Another fact on Sessegnon: he’s the first player born after 2000 to score in the Premier League. That’s the first ever Premier League goal for Fulham’s young star. He burst off a Mitrovic flick and finished coolly. Oh, Newcastle. This really isn’t going well for Rafa. How long until insurrection breaks out. A scrambled goal that came off a pair of deflections after Shane Duffy’s header and José Izquierdo volley. Kayal got the last touch but maybe didn’t know much about it. Luckless Macclesfield Town have had a goal disallowed. West Ham and Tottenham is not much of a game, according to our snouts. Possession for both teams but not much else. More woes for Fulham as their goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli is in the wars after colliding with Dennis Odoi. Time ticking on Jokanovic: Fulham’s defence is chaotic to say the very least. Two in a minute, and this time a smart finish from the Argentinian. Watford score against the run of play and then... They are flying in. More chaos in Fulham’s defence and Bobby Reid slots in after another one on one. A regulation close-range finish for the Argentine goal machine’s 149th Premier League goal. Needless to say, poor Fulham defending let this one happen. Murphy slotted in after a one on one. Glenn Murray did indeed have to leave the field at Newcastle and has been replaced by Jurgen Locadia. That was after a clash of heads with Federico Fernandez. We told you to expect goals between Fulham and Cardiff and that was pretty special. The German has been excellent this season and he smashed in from about 35 yards. Dream start for Dean Smith and JT at Villa: Tammy Abraham has scored against Swansea. Worries at Newcastle, where Brighton’s Glenn Murray has taken a bang to the head and is receiving medical assistance and is highly unlikely to carry on. Nottingham Forest are leading 1-0 against Norwich; Lewis Grabban scored against his old club. Newcastle’s Ayoze Pérez has also missed a good chance, after some severe deliberation from Brighton’s Gaetan Bong. All happening between Manchester City and Burnley where Vincent Kompany was very lucky to get away with only a yellow card for a high challenge on Aaron Lennon. Sergio Aguero has also missed a good chance. First goal of the day goes to Crawley’s Joe Maguire, who scored against Newport. A word on Newcastle, who have made their worst ever start to a top-division season. And considering the chaos that has enveloped that club, that’s saying something. Not a great deal of optimism on Tyneside when I was up there last weekend. 3pm kick-offs are underway. What magic awaits? Down in the very depths of the Football League, Macclesfield Town are trying to avoid an unwanted record. They equalled the English league record of 36 consecutive games without a win by losing at Tranmere last week. Lose their home match against Carlisle and ignominy awaits. Derby County in 2007 and 2008 are joint holders and it might be said that Macc’s losing run incorporates a six-year spell in the Conference. Meanwhile, in touchline rumble news, José Mourinho has accepted an apology from Marco Ianni, the Chelsea coach who celebrated Ross Barkley’s equaliser in front of him. A final call for the weekend Premier League preview. More Germany news, where Jadon Sancho has opened the scoring for Borussia Dortmund against Stuttgart. Drama here, to say the very least. Elsewhere on the continent, Bayern Munich are one of Europe’s crisis clubs, along with Real Madrid and just-about-to-beat-Chelsea Manchester United. They travel to Wolfsburg this afternoon, their bosses having responded to recent media criticism in the style of a Trump Thursday night rally. The big team news is that Kevin de Bruyne will be on the bench for Manchester City, just as Christian Eriksen will be for Tottenham. European news: Real Madrid lose again, despite breaking their goal duck. The presence of Isaac Success can only make one hum Iggy Pop’s Here Comes Success.

Manchester City will welcome back Kevin de Bruyne at some point in their home match with Burnley. West Ham lost 3-2 to Tottenham last season at the London but might fancy their chances against a patched-up Spurs.

It was a particularly harsh dismissal and only served to deepen the affection of Tynesiders for the popular man they dubbed “Comrade Chris” in recognition of his leftwing politics. Four managers and a relegation later, Ashley has the top-notch Rafael Benítez in charge but will most definitely not have enjoyed watching the decorated Spaniard outmanoeuvred by Hughton’s Brighton on another dreadful day for Newcastle. An already appalling – and winless – start to the season was further compounded by a fifth straight home defeat that left Newcastle with only two points and contemplating a long, hard winter. Granted, it took a deflected goal from a dubious corner and some fine goalkeeping from Mathew Ryan for Brighton to win it, but the boos at the final whistle reflected the reality that Newcastle lacked the creativity to prevent themselves from being sent to the bottom of the table. The game was swiftly halted for several minutes while Brighton’s Glenn Murray received treatment on the pitch following a nasty clash of heads with Federico Fernández. After a worrying hiatus, Murray was taken straight to the nearby Royal Victoria Infirmary with medical staff stretchering him straight to an emergency exit in a corner of the ground, where an ambulance waited.

First, he directed a looping header from Aaron Cresswell’s cross towards the top corner only for the goalkeeper to claw to safety at full stretch while shortly afterwards, he shot low and true but Lloris touched around the far post. At the very end, Arnautovic wriggled free of Sánchez only for Lloris to leave his line and block.",

          "bodyText": "Amidst international scorn for Saudi Arabia’s official explanation of the death of Jamal Khashoggi, friends and colleagues of the reporter on Saturday resumed their vigil outside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, where he was killed two weeks ago. They were there to mourn his death and demand “true justice”. In the US, Saudi Arabia’s major ally, the Trump administration remained cautiously supportive of the Riyadh line. But pressure was building. Bob Corker, chair of the powerful Senate foreign relations committee, doubted the Saudi version of events and said the US “must make its own independent, credible determination of responsibility for Khashoggi’s murder”. After more than two weeks of stubborn denials from Saudi Arabia that it had anything to do with Khashoggi’s disappearance, statements carried on the state news agency in the early hours of Saturday finally acknowledged his death – the result, it said, of a “fistfight” inside the consulate on 2 October. The statements said 18 men had been arrested in connection with the “cover-up” and two senior officials – confidantes of Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman – had been sacked. Khashoggi’s body was disposed of by a “local collaborator”, officials added. Khashoggi was a Saudi national but a US permanent resident. Saudi Arabia had been under significant pressure from the White House to offer an explanation in an escalating diplomatic crisis. Its eventual account met with widespread scepticism, however, in the face of mounting evidence from the Turkish investigation into Khashoggi’s death pointing to a sophisticated assassination operation that could not have been carried out without the sanction of the Saudi royal court. Turkish officials have coordinated sustained leaks to local and US media that suggest Khashoggi was tortured and murdered and dismembered with a bone saw. Investigators allege 15 men who arrived in Istanbul from Riyadh on jets owned by the Saudi royal family were sent to kill the reporter. Several of the suspects – including members of the crown prince’s security detail and a forensics expert – were captured in security camera footage entering the consulate building on the day Khashoggi died. On Saturday, Saudi Arabia’s allies in the region expressed support. The UK, another ally, cautiously acknowledged the Saudi version of events. A statement from the Foreign Office said the government was considering its next steps. But it was not clear the explanation of Khashoggi’s murder, the sackings and purported arrests would contain the damage to Riyadh. At the United Nations, a spokesman said secretary general António Guterres was “deeply troubled” and “stresses the need for a prompt, thorough and transparent investigation into the circumstances of Mr Khashoggi’s death and full accountability for those responsible”. Outside government circles, Amnesty International called for “an impartial and independent investigation by the UN”. In the US, the White House put out a statement “acknowledging” the Saudi account of what it called “this tragic incident” and adding that it would follow developments. Donald Trump’s son, Eric, went on Fox News to repeat the line that US-Saudi relations are too important, for commercial and strategic reasons, to give up because of the death of a journalist. But it was becoming increasingly clear that Republican leaders in Congress were not going to give credibility to the Saudi version of events and would insist on a full investigation by US intelligence, potentially followed by sanctions mandated by legislation known as Global Magnitsky, after a murdered Russian lawyer. “Saudi Arabia’s changing stories on Khashoggi’s murder is getting old,” the Florida senator Marco Rubio tweeted. “The latest one about a fistfight gone bad is bizarre. We must move forward with Global Magnitsky investigation we requested, find out what really happened and sanction those responsible.” Corker said: “The story the Saudis have told about Jamal Khashoggi’s disappearance continues to change with each passing day, so we should not assume their latest story holds water. “They can undergo their own investigation, but the US administration must make its own independent, credible determination of responsibility for Khashoggi’s murder under the Global Magnitsky investigation as required by law.” The administration has 120 days from the day the Senate invoked Magnitsky, 10 October, to present the results of an investigation and a decision on sanctions.

This crime cannot go unpunished. Spilling his blood has only made the case stronger against the cruelty and repression of Saudi Arabia.”",

          "body": "<p>In two social media posts last week, the British racing driver Lewis Hamilton showed where he has come from and how far he has travelled. The first was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LewisHamilton/status/1052287731483779072\" title=\"\">a link to an eight-minute <em>Blue Peter</em> tribute</a>, in which he appears for approximately two seconds. The feature was on radio-controlled cars and Hamilton displays a focus and determination that would prove handy in later life by thrashing presenter John Leslie. He was seven at the time, living with his mum on an estate in Stevenage. “Remember being on <em>Blue Peter</em> like it was yesterday,” the 33-year-old wrote on Twitter.</p> <p>In the next post, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LewisHamilton/status/1052576656320282624\" title=\"\">Hamilton is in New York</a>, filming himself last week on his phone in front of a giant billboard on which he appears in full racing garb. “Mamma I made it,” he comments, “that’s me on the Nasdaq building in Times Square.”</p> <p>Hamilton certainly has made it. Already he is a four-time Formula One champion, as well as Britain’s wealthiest sportsperson (his fortune is estimated at about £130m). And on Sunday, just after 7pm, he will set out to claim his fifth title at the US Grand Prix in Austin, Texas. If Hamilton wins and Sebastian Vettel finishes in third place or lower, the crown will be his.</p> <p>Vettel will be stiffer competition than Leslie, no doubt, but Hamilton – with nine race wins already this season in his Mercedes – has been close to unstoppable in 2018. History appears to be on his side, too: of the six grands prix held in Austin, he has won five. One more statistic: in total, Hamilton has recorded 71 race wins in Formula One and it seems only a matter of time before he overhauls Michael Schumacher’s record of 91 career victories. If that happens, who could deny that Hamilton is a contender for the greatest Formula One driver ever? Last week, his long-time rival Fernando Alonso <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/45905592\" title=\"\">named him in his all-time top five</a>.</p> <p>Hamilton may live in Monte Carlo these days, and his voice has a distinct Anglo-American twang, but he has clearly not forgotten where it all started. His <em>Blue Peter</em> experience is one example, and often in interviews he talks fondly of his early days driving karts, marvelling at how unlikely it is that someone from his background – and his ethnicity – could break into the privileged, very white world of Formula One.</p> <p>“I grew up seeing kids arriving in helicopters and stuff,” he recalled recently, at the launch in Tokyo of his new fashion collection with Tommy Hilfiger. “Me and my dad were in our Fiat Cinquecento and they were turning up in their Lamborghinis.”</p> <p>Hamilton added that he hopes it will still be possible for the “diamonds in the rough” to come through in Formula One. “You can’t beat that raw natural hunger,” he said. “If I had a kid right now he would have such an easy life, and there is no way he is going to be as hungry as me.”</p> <p>Seeing Hamilton showering his rivals with champagne on the podium every fortnight, it can be easy to forget what an unlikely journey he has had. His father Anthony is the child of Grenadian immigrants, his mother Carmen is white British; they separated when Lewis – named after the sprinter Carl Lewis – was two. Everyone agrees that Hamilton was a natural at karting, but his father had to take redundancy from British Rail to chaperone him to races. In the gaps, he did three jobs, including putting up “for sale” signs for a local estate agent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"013f109ca747e3bad0cef027940ded229a46838e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/013f109ca747e3bad0cef027940ded229a46838e/0_202_3253_1953/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lewis Hamilton, aged 10, ready for a drive at Kimbolton race track in England\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Go-karting prodigy Lewis Hamilton aged 10.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philip Brown/Popperfoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hamilton first signed a deal with McLaren aged 13, but still his rise was not entirely straightforward.
